## How to contribute code

- Pull the latest `master` from GitHub
- Branch from the latest commit on `master`.
- Commit your changes on the branch. This can be several commits which can be code easier to review.
- Push your branch up to GitHub.
- Create a Pull Request to merge your branch into `master`
- Once reviewed and approved, press the merge button.
- If your code requires changes, make the changes on your branch and push up the new commits.

**Do not commit your code straight to master.**
